## About

<a id="about"></a>
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Christos Davatzikos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RId1qZ8AAAAJ&hl=en) in the [AI2D: Center for AI and Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics](https://ai2d.med.upenn.edu/). I'm also a member of [PennSIVE](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) (Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor), where I collaborate closely with [Prof. Haochang Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DFwje0AAAAAJ&hl=en). Alongside my Ph.D., I have completed an M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, focusing on Bayesian statistics and statistical inference. My M.Sc. thesis, advised by [Prof. Edgar Dobriban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aGvH4yMAAAAJ&hl=en) and by [Prof. George J. Pappas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kia-4B0AAAAJ&hl=en), explored Conformal Prediction for Longitudinal Biomarker Trajectories. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in the field of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Technical University of Athens, under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Maragos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A2XydgGCY9gC&hl=en), where I conducted research on sequential learning for handwritten text recognition.
