## About

<a id="about"></a>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Christos Davatzikos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RId1qZ8AAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Imaging Laboratory](https://ai2d.med.upenn.edu/). I'm also a member of [PennSIVE](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) (Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor), where I collaborate closely with [Prof. Haochang Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DFwje0AAAAAJ&hl=en). Alongside my Ph.D., I am pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at the Wharton School, with a focus on Conformal Prediction for Longitudinal Trajectories, advised by [Prof. Edgar Dobriban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aGvH4yMAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my PhD, 

I hold an M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science and an M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, providing me with a strong interdisciplinary foundation across engineering, statistics, and computer science.

My research interests encompass machine learning and deep learning, with particular attention to their applications in healthcare. Throughout my Ph.D., I have gained extensive experience working with statistical models, Bayesian methods, and deep kernel learning. My research leverages imaging and genomic data to predict the progression of neurodegeneration, particularly in Alzheimer's Disease and Brain Aging. My work emphasizes the intersection of AI and healthcare, blending statistical rigor with machine learning techniques. I primarily develop deep learning models for progression prediction, with a strong focus on fairness and interpretability.
